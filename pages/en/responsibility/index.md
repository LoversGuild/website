For many, sexuality is a very sensitive and private topic.
Often in our society, violations of sexuality are not taken seriously and the harmed person is instead instructed to keep quiet about what transpired.

At the Lovers' Guild we want to create intimate events responsibly.
We take matters of safety seriously, both when it comes to privacy and respecting everyone's boundaries.

On this website you will find information on how we take care that the data of our guests is protected, and how you should act if faced with harassment within our events or conversation groups.

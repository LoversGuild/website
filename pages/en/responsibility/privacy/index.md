We take our guests' privacy seriously, both within our events as well as on our website.
On this page we explain our principles on the collection and use of personal data.

# WARNING: Phishing and misuse of information

Phishing and the misuse of gained data and its use for blackmail happens often online.
We will never ask for your personal information on any social media site or on any site in general other than [rakastajienkilta.fi][kilta] or [loversguild.org][guild].

[kilta]: https://rakastajienkilta.fi/
[guild]: https://loversguild.org/

When you send us your information through email, make sure that the domain part of the address you are writing to is either rakastajienkilta.fi or loversguild.org.
Our voluteers always use email addresses with one of the afforementioned domain parts.

# Events

In order to organize safe events and to invite participants to them, we must gather some data about our participants.
We only gather information that is relevant to the individual's participation and to the Lovers' Guild's continued and improved activities.
We do not save anyone's personal data without their explicit consent.
We do not sell or otherwise give away anyone's data to outside parties.
Everyone also has the right to check their data and to demand changes to them.

We keep a [participant registry][registry] for our events that contain sexual expression and interaction.
Everyone participating in our events would be well-advised to read our participant [register statement (unfortunately available only in Finnish)][registry].

# Website

On our website, we only gather data relevant to the use and functionality of our homepage. 
We do not attempt to identify individual guests by, for example, using cookies.
Our site has no ad analytics nor do we send retrieval requests containing personal information to external sites, such as data analytics services or social media sites.

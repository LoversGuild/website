The Lover's guild is an unincorporated association whose goals are: 

- to increase people's awareness of the vast power and potential in their own sexuality â€“ both on the level of individuals and communities,
- to support and encourage people to explore and express sexuality consciously,
- to make the world a more loving place where sexuality is appreciated and celebrated consciously, freely and openly, without shame or fear.

The majority of humanity has caused itself massive harm both as a collective and for its members as individuals by making sexuality a taboo and by repressing its expression.
In The Lovers' Guild we want to take part in correcting this mistake and the harm caused by it.

To help achieve this goal, The Lovers' Guild will:

- organize events that enable the conscious expression of sexuality,
- support the organizing of such events:
  - by publishing guides and communication materials and software developed for our own activities,
  - by offering personal consultation for planning and organizing events,
- organize other events and carry out projects that enable the freedom of people's sexual expression,
- share information about conscious sexuality,
- co-operate with other parties to fulfil these shared goals.

All of our activities are guided by these following principles:

- Being loving
: We want to face each other acceptingly and with open hearts.
  Every meeting is special in its own way.
  No one is a tool to us, but an irreplaceable being in their own right.

- Consensuality
: People's sexual interactions should always be based on a mutual agreement and consent.
  This is how it should be in the world in general, always and everywhere!

- Openness
: For us, openness means free self-expression, questioning of taboos, welcoming those who want to join our community, transparency in our activity and decision-making, as well as the open sharing of knowledge.

- Honesty
: Sincere communication will result in sincere relationships between people.
  As our own true selves, we will be understood and loved on a deeper level.

- Courage
: We encourage people to face and accept themselves, to grow in the direction they want to, to search and explore their boundaries and to express themselves consciously.
  The relationship with oneself is the most difficult relationship for many, but improving it is often very rewarding.

- The recognition and respect of sexual autonomy
: Everyone has the right to express their sexuality in ways that do not harm others.
  This right is not dependent on any external factor such as one's age, social status, body or health.

- Safety
: Safety is born from trust, open communication, taking of responsibility and respecting everyone's personal boundaries.
  Safety is a prerequisite of opening up and letting go.

- Spirituality
: To us, spirituality is not related to religion.
  Spirituality is the state of being present consciously and the desire to witness our life experience as a whole.
  Making love can be turned into a deeply spiritual and sacred experience.
  Sacred, to us, means something that has intrinsic value and is to be respected.
  At Lovers' Guild's events we aim to create a sacred space for sacred meetings.

- Pleasure and sensuality
: Pleasure is healing.
  Pleasure makes us open up and trust each other and life as a whole.
  Ascetism isn't the only way we can try to achieve spiritual growth.
  Pleasure is a vital part of elation and nourishing relationships.

- Responsibility
: As human beings, sexuality is a very vulnerable part of us.
  With great freedom comes great responsibility.
  We want to bear this responsibility by, for example, creating safe spaces and by offering personal support and making sure everyone's privacy is taken care of.

- Eco-consciousness
: On top of taking care of other people, we are also responsible for everything that we do to our home planet.
  We want to act in a way that is as ethically and ecologically sustainable as possible.

- Sobriety
: Sincere, safe and open sexual interaction requires that we do not alter the state of our mind with foreign substances.

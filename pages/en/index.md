Welcome to the homepage of *the Lovers' Guild*! 

*The Lovers' Guild* is an unincorporated association which organises and develops events on conscious sexual expression, and also offers its expertise to support the organization of similar events.
Our goal is to make the world a more loving place where sexuality is appreciated and celebrated consciously, freely and openly, without shame or fear.
Our core activity is the organization of gatherings called [*Gentle orgies*][orgy].

We have created many supplementary materials for the Gentle orgies that can be used by people organizing similar events.
We also offer personal consultation to the organizers of conscious sexual expression events.

On this website we tell more about our activity and share the guidelines used in our activities, our communication materials and [software][github].

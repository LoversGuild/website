# History of Gentle orgies in short

Gentle orgies have been organized since 2018.
As of September 2024, we have organized a total of 24 orgies.
All gatherings have been held at the homes of the organizers in Helsinki. 
So far, a total of ten people have worked as organizers of these orgies.

In 2019 an association was founded in order to organize the orgies. orgies.
In the past years, Gentle orgies have transformed from experimental sex parties to very professionally organized gatherings of sexual exploration and expression.
Despite the professional organization, we have successfully kept the direct and informal atmosphere of the orgies. 

# Statistics of Gentle orgies

The participant registry of the Lovers' Guild provides answers for some statistical questions: 
Participants are about 20 to 55 years old.
The average age of participants is 33.7 years old and the vast majority is somewhere between 27 and 36 years old.

We do not keep statistics of the participants' gender identities, but we ask the participants themselves about their genitalia and sexual orientation.
In the following we use terms derived from animal biology in order to completely forgo the topic of gender.

According to their own words, about 58% of participants are female and about 42% male, with room for a few individuals whose genitalia do not fit these coarse categories.
84% of participants are sexually interested in females.
71% of participants are sexually interested in males.
54% of participants self-identify as pansexual.

According to the Lovers' Guilds unofficial estimate, at least 30% of the participants have children.
This estimate is, however, only indicative at best and based on our personal observations.

Partners, friends and other avecs are welcome to Gentle orgies.
Joining with a partner or a friend may make one feel less nervous than coming to a new event by oneself. 
You and your avec's relationship need not be sexual, not within the orgies or outside them. 

The experience can be beautiful and unifying for you.
It can also be hard and painful if you experience feelings of jealousy.

We expect you to participate in the orgies as individuals, not as a unit.
That does not mean you can't play with each other.
However, if you exclude others categorically from your activities, you will be breaking the unity of the group.

Any attempts to limit another's play by either interfering with who they choose to make love to or their freedom of self-expression do not belong to Gentle orgies.
This also goes for people who are in a relationship together.

In orgies, jealousy over your partner's activities may surprise you.
In moments like these, it is often best to meditate, breathe and ask for support from other participants and organizers.
It is not advised to go get support from your partner in the middle of their play as that will interrupt your partner's meeting and most importantly prevent yourself from accepting the situation.
Interrupting a partner's playtime can be an unconscious attempt to control or manipulate one's partner.
It can also give your partner the impression that what they are doing isn't desirable. 

We recommend that before you join Gentle orgies with your partner or partners, you openly and thoroughly discuss your wishes, expectations and fears.
Love making in Gentle orgies is very intimate and close. 
You may well see your partner crying from how touched and overjoyed they are, laughing infatuatedly or sleeping happily in a new person's embrace.
If thoughts like these feel daunting, it is advisable you participate in the orgies separately.

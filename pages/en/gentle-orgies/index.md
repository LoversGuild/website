*Gentle orgies* are loving gatherings of conscious sexual expression.
Their purpose is to enable one to explore and improve one's relationship to themselves as a sexual being, and to enjoy and celebrate sexuality in an open, intimate, accepting, respectful and safe environment.

Gentle orgies' values are sincerity, sensitivity, consent, naturalness, presence and caring for others.
In orgies we get to know each other, play, make love, eat, talk and sleep together.
All participation is voluntary and based on consent. 
Our orgies are sober.

Our gatherings usually have 12 to 16 participants.
Orgies start generally on a Saturday afternoon and continue until early afternoon on Sunday.
At this moment our gatherings are held in Helsinki.

On these pages we tell you in detail about our values, principles, the practical arrangements of our orgies, our community and about how you can join our activities â€“ both as a participant and as an organizer.

# Editing the site

All site contents are in the `pages/`, `static/` and `templates/` directories within this repository.

Page contenst are written in the Markdown documentation format.
We use [Pandoc][pandoc] for rendering the page contents.
See [the Pandoc User's Guide][pandoc-guide] for details about Pandoc's extended Markdown syntax.

[pandoc]: https://pandoc.org/
[pandoc-guide]: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html

For page templates, we use Pandoc's templates.
These are also documented in Pandoc's manual.

Metadata for template substitution is partially autogenerated by LoveGen.
Most of the metadata is stored in YAML format in content pages' YAML metadata block.
Every subdirectory (under `pages/`) may also contain a `meta.yaml` file.
These files can be used to provide default template values for all pages in their directory and its subdirectories.
Metadata values in `meta.yaml` files deeper in directory hierarchy override values in parent `meta.yaml` files.
Metadata in content files overrides all values provided by `meta.yaml` files.

An exception to this overriding rule is that mapping values in metadata are combined and lists are concatenated to each other.


Rendered site is written to the `output/` directory.
LoveGen generates a hierarchical menu for every page.
Page hierarchy in the generated site is determined from the directory hiearchy of the original contents.
Every `pages/.../pagename.md` file is translated to HTML and written to `output/.../pagename/index.html`.

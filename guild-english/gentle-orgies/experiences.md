# Me, 31

> What is love and how is it intertwined with desire?

> I came here, to Gentle orgies, to explore my own boundaries and to be open.
> To move on skin and in tissue under the skin.
> To caress and enjoy.
> I came, and I came with tenderness.
> You can't force your boundaries or heart open, nor should you.
> You can be invited and accepted.
> That is happiness, and that is love.
>
> There is something fundamental which calls me in a community of loving people, gentleness and acceptance of everyone.
> Worry, sadness and pain are also valuable aspects of you and I sense them all in myself and in others during the evening.
> The deep undercurrent of sexuality and force of life flowed strongly in the shared space, and I finally had a place to desire another, others, together and mating.

> What is it when you almost kiss someone the first time you meet them?
>
> We get closer to one another, listening, playing in the exercises.
> You have to identify the “no” in yourself and other living beings.
> We find ways to express refusal also in ways that does not lead to leaving but in dialogue, and the other will gain understanding of how to act in line with our wishes.
> The other hand barely touches my boundaries.
> Here I am.
>
> This might require a certain type of openness for new experiences—orgies open up that potential in me.
> At the same time, there is something primeval in this. 
> People have been making love and sleeping together for millions of years.
> Here is present the memory of our species and the sacredness of life.

# Woman, 20

> These orgies opened up a new miraculous dimension into my sexuality and feelings.
> It was amazing just how loved and safe I felt even as someone attending for the first time. 
> Thanks to the accepting atmosphere, it just somehow felt very natural to make love in a shared space with all these sweet people.

# Genderfluid, 27

> Before orgies I felt quite unsure of myself sexually.
> I had gotten unpleasant comments about my queerness and feminine behaviour.
> These hit such a sore spot for me that it was hard for me to approach anyone sexually.
>
> [In the orgies] I felt wanted and loved just the way I was.
> Everyone's compliments and thanks warmed my heart greatly.
> The event was very safe and I was able to give in to my desires while trusting others to take care of their own boundaries.
> The communication was wonderfully open!
> Thanks to the relaxed and playful atmosphere it was easy to find likeminded playmates and to let love blossom between us.
>
> I also very much enjoyed how the night was organized.
> We built up the feelings of safety step by step with good exercises.
> My greatest nervousness evaporated during the introductions.

> Now I am much more sexually confident and feel myself whole.
> This was a wildly wonderful and healing experience for me!

# Non-binary, 30

> For me, gentle orgies have been both a place and a temple of unbelievable tenderness, intense excitement and rewarding discussions as well as deep self-reflection and growth of self-knowledge.
> Very few gatherings in general have such a comfortable and present atmosphere, especially with people who are new to one another!

# Girlboy, 36

> Every time, even though I have seen dozens of orgies, my nervousness makes the blood escape my hands and sweat run down from my armpits in streams.
> I try to breathe and my sides feel tight.
> Foreign faces and voices, exchanges of feelings and tea at the kitchen table.
> Will you be the ones taking my dress of soon?
> Are you the ones I will be sinking my tongue into?
> Is it your hearts that I will feel against mine?
>
> Within a few hours the same table will have naked butts around it.
> “I want to play with you. May I caress your breasts?” I ask, and you say: “Yes” or “no”, and I thank you.
> It is all so easy and natural.
> I laugh with you and I tell you about my life as if we had known each other for years even though we just met tonight.

> And what made us so beloved to each other?
> Fingers in hair, a first kiss shared by three of us, my hands on your back as sweat is dripping into your eyes as you two melt into one another in ecstasy.

# Woman, 47

> I was quite timid about attending the orgies as I felt myself an old lady already and I was afraid I'd be left by my lonesome as a wallflower, but that fear turned out to be for nothing.

> I felt myself in the midst of a gentle, appreciative and loving group of people who expressed these feelings, in addition to sex, with hugs and caresses.
> I warmly recommend Gentle orgies to others! 

# Man, 27

> The atmosphere was accepting and respectful the whole time.
> The intro and exercises brought a feeling of safety to the event.
> Getting to know other people's bodies was also a great exercise.
> At least when it comes to myself, I felt that I achieved a connection with another person quite quickly and therefore was able to approach others easily afterwards.
> I also liked the nice change between cuddling and sex.
> It didn't feel like we came here to just fuck, like how some **not so conscious** events sometimes tend to feel.
> I felt that during this event it was easy (and pleasurable) to be with people that I maybe wouldn't usually approach.

# Pansexual woman, 28

> I was attending orgies for the first time and therefore didn't really know what to expect.
> It's typical for me to get nervous around new people and I was indeed very nervous at first.
> But already as I was doing the exercises, I caught myself feeling unusually comfortable and relaxed.
>
> The tantric exercises that lasted several hours made the participants present feel like a group that it felt natural to share with intimate things regarding feelings and wishes regarding shared pleasure. 
> It was touching to hear others' experiences on humanity and to relate to them and also find new understanding. 

> On top of helping the group come together, the exercises were also helpful especially in letting me get to know myself and making me think about my relationship with my body from a new perspective, among other things. 
>
> Making love when others were present and with multiple people as well as witnessing others' love-making, were beautiful new experiences.
> A day with these people was in many ways pleasurable, nourishing and freeing.

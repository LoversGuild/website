Protection is an important topic that is actively brought up in *Gentle orgies*.
We want to be able to surrender to pleasure, and that is simply not possible if we do not feel we are safe.

In our gatherings, everyone sets their boundaries themselves, and that also applies to things concerning protection.
Because there is no such thing as completely safe sex, it is advisable that everyone reflects thoroughly on what risks they are willing to take.
When horny people make love to each other in a big pile, it is important for everyone to acknowledge the consequences of their choices when it comes to themselves and others. 

Information helps us in making decisions.
Unfortunately, there are often no unambiguous scientifically proven facts. 
The methods and probabilities of infection are known quite well for some infections.
In some situations infections are so rare that it is extremely hard to acquire scientific proof of their spreading.

When researching STIs (sexually transmitted infections) it is important to be critical of your sources.
Some sex-negative groups and officials often exaggerate the risks associated with STIs.

In orgies, there are often as many protection practices used as there are guests.
Some want to protect themselves from all mucosa contact and fluids;
on the other hand, some find much joy in them.

We openly discuss our general requirements when it comes to protection. 
However, methods of protection used are always dependent on the situation and person.
We are free to change our minds and to deviate from the general requirements we have expressed.

We hope everyone shares their STI situation together in a circle.
This will increase the feelings of trust and safety within the group.
For many, it is important to hear when others got tested, which samples were taken from them and what the results were.

Most of us have received sex education in school that focused largely on STI and pregnancy related fearmongering.
We want to avoid demonization and fearmongering in Gentle orgies.
We can be careful without getting anxious.
Matter of the fact is, most STIs are curable and only cause temporary discomfort to their carrier or only become dangerous when left untreated.

We happily accept everyone's choices when it comes to protecting themselves and we do not judge them for being too strict or liberal.

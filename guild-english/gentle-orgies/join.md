We are always looking for new caring, gentle, conscious, responsible, trustworthy and open people to join our lustful group.
If you have carefully read through this site—including the parts about Gentle orgies as well as the Lovers' Guild in general—and you feel the call to join our gatherings, we hope that you bravely approach us.

If you are unsure but curious, we can answer your questions and help you make a decision.
Our goal is to help people recognize their desires and boundaries, not to test them recklessly. 

Because orgies are a very sensitive and intimate space, we want to make sure that we only invite absolutely trustworthy and responsible guests.
We interview every willing participant personally.
For the most part, we do these interviews by phone and occasionally face-to-face.

Sadly we cannot guarantee that you will receive an invite to the orgies.
Each and every one of us organizers does this work voluntarily and from passion within their heart.
How often orgies are held depends on the resources of the organizers, the amount of participants and the compatibility of their sexual orientations. 

# How can I join? 

Send us an email. 
You can find the address on our [Contact page][contact].

[contact]: ../../contact/

In your message, tell us about yourself, your relationship with your sexuality and your motivation for joining.
We will not judge nor rate you nor your interests.
We take pleasure in sincere and honest messages that resemble the writer themselves.

# Can I join with an avec?

Yes.
Your avec does not have to be your sex partner, you may also join with a friend.

You and your avec may send us your introductions together or separately.
However, do make sure to first read more about participating together with [avecs][avecs].

[avecs]: ../avecs/

# How do I know I can trust you? 

Open communication with us is also important for your own sake.
You have the opportunity to make contact with a human person before you make the decision to join the orgies.
You do not have to make the decision just based off the website or invitation letter. 

Your name and contact info will never be shared nor used for any other purpose than contacting you.
They will also not be recorded in our [participant registry][privacy] without your written consent.

# Do you reply to all messages? 

Every now and then we are quite busy, so be prepared to not receive a reply quite immediately.

We get a fair amount of messages that are either inappropriate or whose sender clearly hasn't familiarized themselves with our organization's philosophy and principles or hasn't understood them.
Some messages are so short or general in nature that we are unable to grasp what kind of person is behind the email.
We also receive messages from seemingly fake e-mails, with seemingly fake names or without names at all.
We do not want to waste our limited time on responding to such messages.
